# How to contribute
We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or
just correct a typo, please feel free to do so, as long as you follow
our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Shopify/storefront-api-examples/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an
issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the
project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Getting Started
To start working on the codebase, follow the example specific `README` in each directory.
